#In this Currency Convertor project look very simple but I face some problems that thought me many things like - 

#Components reuseability: -
    In this one I thought how to create a custom element and its attributes. How can we able reuse that element with different attributes and many more.
#Create Custom Hooks -
    In this project I also learn about How can we can able to create custom hooks. In this I create a custom hook called useCurrency which I use to create a request to a API that provides currency and it's parameters. And I use those data to create a selection option of currency and use it to convertion the currency from one to another.
    

*I also learn about that in React If we use map or filter we always have to pass a key with it
